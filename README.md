# What is SQL? </br>
SQL is short for Structured Query Language. Originally, it used to be called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) and was used for storing and manipulating data in databases. Today SQL is used to perform all types of data operations in relational database management systems (RDBMS).

SQL is a powerful language where we can perform a wide range of operations:

execute queries
fetch data
insert, update, and delete records in a database (DML operations)
create new objects in a database (DDL operations)
set permissions on tables, procedures, functions, and views
and much, much more...
